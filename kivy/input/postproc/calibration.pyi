class InputPostprocCalibration:
    '''Recalibrate the inputs.

    The configuration must go within a section named `postproc:calibration`.
    Within the section, you must have a line like::

        devicename = param=value,param=value

    If you wish to match by provider, you must have a line like::

        (provider) = param=value,param=value

    :Parameters:
        `xratio`: float
            Value to multiply X
        `yratio`: float
            Value to multiply Y
        `xoffset`: float
            Value to add to X
        `yoffset`: float
            Value to add to Y
        `auto`: str
            If set, then the touch is transformed from screen-relative
            to window-relative The value is used as an indication of
            screen size, e.g for fullHD:

                auto=1920x1080

            If present, this setting overrides all the others.
            This assumes the input device exactly covers the display
            area, if they are different, the computations will be wrong.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.11.0
        Added `auto` parameter
