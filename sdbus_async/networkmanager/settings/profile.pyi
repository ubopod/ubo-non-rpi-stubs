    Connection profiles
    -------------------

    NetworkManager is based on a concept of connection profiles, most often
    referred to just as "connections". Connection profiles provide a network
    configuration. When NetworkManager activates a connection profile on a
    network device, the configuration will be applied and an active network
    connection will be established. Users are free to create as many
    connection profiles as they see fit. Thus they are flexible in having
    various network configurations for different networking needs:
    https://networkmanager.pages.freedesktop.org/NetworkManager/NetworkManager/nm-settings-dbus.html

    Connection profiles are handled by NetworkManager via a settings service
    and are exported on D-Bus (/org/freedesktop/NetworkManager/Settings/<num>)

    Definition of a connection profile:
    A specific, encapsulated, independent group of settings describing
    all the configuration required to connect to a specific network.

    It is referred to by a unique identifier called the UUID.
    A connection profile is tied to a one specific device type,
    but not necessarily a specific hardware device.

    A connection profile is composed of one or more Settings objects.

    Settings objects
    ----------------

    A group of related key/value pairs describing a specific piece
    of a Connection (profile). Keys are also referred to as properties.
